# Perkovic, Ljubomir - Introduction to Computing Using Python - Edition 1

# Source code associated with completing this text

# Folders are organized with master files containing all/most of the
# source code (examples and practice problems) of a chapter, except
# where I felt it was more appropriate to contain a piece of code
# within its own file (such as case study examples)

# I/O files are also included as if code were already succesfully run
